# 2025-04-27 - first entry!

## background
language model project:
* 500 - 700 m params
* muon, scalable softmax, value residual connections, multi head latent attn, min-p sampling
* want to maximize conversational coherence 
* will be trained on 1 nvidia rtx 4080 gpu

gonna have 1 'toy' model (90m params for ablation testing) and a main one


progress:
* still writing model code (mla)

## today
gonna try to finish as much of the model code as possible

## tomorrow
have 2 config.yamls locking in the hyperparams?
